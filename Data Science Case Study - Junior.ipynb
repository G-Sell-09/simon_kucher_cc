    "# Problem Description\n",
    "***alles um tier GmBH*** is a pet supplies company. They are currently auditing their promotional activities and the CEO, one of the main stakeholders, feels that the promotions they offer is too generic and not targeted. They have requested us to devise a customer segmentation model that they can use to run targeted promotional activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The client is interested in seeing what kind of customers are buying at ***alles um tier GmbH***. They assume that, in addition to private individuals, there are also smaller companies that purchase from ***alles um tier GmBH***. The project scope is to build a segmentation model and analyze the resulting customer segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a dataset at customer level for the past year with the following data points. Number of transactions in the past year (*num_transactions*), order amount the past year (*total_order_value*), days between transactions the past year (*days_between_trans*), re-order rate the past year (*repeat_share*), and % of dog products bought (*dog_share*).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Set\n",
    "The dataset consists of 100k rows and has the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* CustomerID (int): UUID for the customer\n",
    "* num_transactions (int): number of transactions in a given year\n",
    "* total_order_value (float): total order value in € for the time period\n",
    "* days_between_trans (float): average days between transactions for a user\n",
    "* repeat_share (float): product share repeated every order\n",
    "* dog_share (float): percentage of products ordered that are dog food related\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Technical Environment\n",
    "* Python\n",
    "* numpy\n",
    "* pandas\n",
    "* scikit-learn\n",
    "* matplotlib / scipy / searborn / altair / plotly\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "The solution is assessed on the following skills:\n",
    "* A thorough evaluation of the data set using statistical measures and visualization\n",
    "* Elegant Python coding skills\n",
    "* Machine learning modelling fundamentals\n",
    "* Model & result evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output\n",
    "Please provide your solution in a jupyter notebook with clear markdown comments.\n",
    "The final output should be in the form of a DataFrame with two columns, the CustomerId and the assigned cluster."
